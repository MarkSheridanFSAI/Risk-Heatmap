#Open the Shiny app you want to publish in RStudio.
#Go to File > Publish to Server > shinyapps.io.
#A dialog will pop up, allowing you to name the app and set any additional options.
#Click Publish, and RStudio will upload your app to shinyapps.io. Youâ€™ll see a progress bar and messages as the app is deployed.
#Once the process completes, RStudio will provide a link to your live app (e.g., https://yourusername.shinyapps.io/appname). You can share this link with others to access the app online.
